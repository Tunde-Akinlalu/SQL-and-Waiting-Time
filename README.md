# SQL-and-Waiting-Time
Exploration of Patients waiting time using data from Electornic Medical Records with SQL and RMySQL, DBplyr etc

Time spent in the hospital by patients plays a great role in the assessment of the hospital's quality of care by the patients.

With over 12gig of data, spanning over a million rows, I try to see how long our patients wait to see a doctor.
This project was carried out in October 2021.

Still a work in progress as we still revisit the issue of timing in our care of out-patients.
